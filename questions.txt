BACKEND
1) For my integration test class, why did I have go instantiate my mockMvc inside
the test instead of autowiring at the class level like i was able to in
my controller test class?  Maybe something to do with order of bean creation?

2) My tests talk to the testdb that is running locally in docker.  I had to manually spin up this docker image
and then manually insert each needed row entry.  Is there a way to make initial db configuration (i.e.
setting password, creating db, entering test rows) automated?

FRONT END
3) My tests pass, but my code doesn't compile....wtf?

4) Plz help me refactor my PlantCollection component to fit best
practices
